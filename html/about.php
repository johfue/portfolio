                <p>Like any child of immigrants, I share the experience of having to translate for my parents at the Burger King. Without anyone to help me with my English homework, I had to learn a lot on my own. And I grew to be a voracious self-learner. Libraries are scared to let me in their doors.</p>
                <p>I’m a recent grad looking to be an art director. Making things people want to look at and like to use is how I get my sick kicks.</p>
