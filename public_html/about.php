                <p>Like any child of immigrants, I share the experience of having to translate for my parents at the Burger King. Without anyone to help me with my English homework, I had to learn a lot on my own. And I grew to be a voracious self-learner. Libraries are scared to let me in their doors.<br><br>I’m currently studying advertising at the University of South Carolina with plans of being an art director. In between classes this semester I've been teaching myself 3D modeling and how to create AR experiences. If you’d like to chat, feel free to <a href="/contact">reach out</a> to me.</p>
